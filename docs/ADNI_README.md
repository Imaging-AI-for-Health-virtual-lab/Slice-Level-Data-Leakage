## ADNI dataset

This supplementary file explains the steps to be followed to get access in to the ADNI MRI data and specifically, the procedures required to select the same subject groups used in our paper [].

1. Go to the link [https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp?project=ADNI] to register an account and to apply for ADNI data use access application by accepting the ADNI data use agreement.

2. Login to your account and click on the DOWNLOAD menu.

3. Choose the option Image Collections.

4. Click on the Advanced Search tab.

5. Specify selection criteria using the checkboxes. Use the combinations of filters (ADNI, ADNI2, AD, MRI, T1, SAGITTAL, 3D and 3T) for filtering the Alzheimer disease and (ADNI, ADNI2, CN, MRI, T1, SAGITTAL, 3D and 3T) the cognitive normal groups.

6. Consider the earliest (the very first) scans of each subject.
